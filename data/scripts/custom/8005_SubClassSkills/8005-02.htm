If your subclass skill is above certain level, you can transfer that power to your main class.<br>
Because this is a very dangerous mission, however, you must be certified in order to carry it out.<br>
If you were certified by your subclass master and have brought the certificate, I will transfer some of your subclass power to your main class.<br>

In order to learn certified subclass skills, you must first speak to Hardin, and obtain the first sealbook. Hardin's Academy is in Dragon Valley.<br>
